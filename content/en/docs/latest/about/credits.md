## Team

Hinode is maintained by [Mark Dumay]({{< param "links.repository_owner" >}}) and several contributors as an open-source repository on [GitHub]({{< param "links.repository" >}}). You are more than welcome to contribute. Get involved in the development by [opening an issue]({{< param "links.issue_tracker" >}}) or submitting a pull request. Read our [contributing guidelines]({{< ref "contribute" >}}) for information on how we develop.

## Core components

Hinode is based on the following core components:

- [Hugo]({{< param "links.hugo" >}}) is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in the [Go language]({{< param "links.golang" >}}). It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with [Markdown content]({{< param "links.markdown_guide" >}}) and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.
- [Bootstrap]({{< param "links.bootstrap" >}}) is a popular, open-source web development framework. Using a mobile-first approach, it provides several functions and components to simplify the creation of responsive websites.
- [npm]({{< param "links.npm" >}}) is a software registry that enables the sharing and reuse of both open-source and private software packages. By taking advantage of its version management, software dependencies are easily tracked and updated.
- [FlexSearch]({{< param "links.flexsearch" >}}) is a flexible search library to enable full text search across your site.
- [Font Awesome]({{< param "links.fontawesome" >}}) is a popular icon library and toolkit, used on over 200 million sites. The free version provides access to more than 2,000 icons. The toolkit also provides various styling and animation options out of the box.

## Optional components

Hinode supports several opt-in components. In the default configuration, these components are added on a page-by-page basis:

- [Leaflet]({{< param "links.leaflet" >}}) is an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.

## Themes

Hinode is inspired by the following themes:

- [Blist]({{< param "links.blist" >}}) is a clean and fast blog theme for your Hugo site using Tailwind CSS.
- [Doks]({{< param "links.doks" >}}) is a Hugo theme for building secure, fast, and SEO-ready documentation websites, which you can easily update and customize.
