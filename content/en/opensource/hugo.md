[Hugo]({{< param "links.hugo" >}}) is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in the [Go language]({{< param "links.golang" >}}). It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with [Markdown content]({{< param "links.markdown_guide" >}}) and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.
