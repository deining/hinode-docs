Hinode is open source and maintains its codebase in [GitHub]({{< param "links.repository" >}}). By releasing new versions as packages on [npm]({{< param "links.npm" >}}), child repositories that reference Hinode can automatically use the latest version available. Hinode itself uses several open-source packages too, including [Bootstrap]({{< param "links.bootstrap" >}}), [FlexSearch]({{< param "links.flexsearch" >}}), and [Font Awesome]({{< param "links.fontawesome" >}}).
