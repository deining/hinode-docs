Hinode supports [Hugo modules]({{< param "links.hugo_modules" >}}) and mounted folders to create a modern, flexible build system. By taking advantage of [npm]({{< param "links.npm" >}}) and [GitHub actions]({{< param "links.github_actions" >}}), you can ensure your deployed site is always up-to-date.
