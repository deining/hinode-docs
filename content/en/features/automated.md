Hinode uses [npm]({{< param "links.npm" >}}) and mounted folders to create a modern, flexible build system. By releasing new versions as packages on [npm]({{< param "links.npm" >}}), child repositories that reference Hinode can automatically use the latest version available. This ensures your deployed site is always up-to-date.
