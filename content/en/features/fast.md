Hinode uses [Hugo]({{< param "links.hugo" >}}), a popular open-source generator, to generate a static website. Static websites do not require a database and can be [hosted virtually anywhere]({{< relref "hosting-and-deployment">}}). Prepare your content in Markdown and take advantage of Hinode's predefined templates to accelerate the development of your site.
